Why are we hearing it so much around the streets of tech\nadvanced areas? Is it some new slang? Are the people using it trying to look cool\nor does it actually mean something ? When you read UI\\\\UX, what comes to your\nmind? What is it? Where did it come from? How did it become such a huge topic\nof interest?`}</p>\n      <p>{`Well, to answer your question, UI is User Interface and UX is User Experience.\nTo simplify it even more, anything that you see on a screen- whether it is your\nphone, tab, laptop or pc, is UI and, what you go through, while using it, is UX.`}</p>\n      <p>{`Essentially, UX applies to anything that can be experienced- be it a website, a\ncoffee machine, or a visit to the supermarket. The “user experience” part refers to\nthe interaction between the user and a product or service.`}</p>\n      <p>{`While user experience is a compilaiton of tasks focused on the optimization of a\nproduct for effective and enjoyable use, user interface design is its complement;\nthe look and feel, the presentation and interactivity of a product.`}</p>\n      <p>{`The UI of any device or website or app revolves arround providing the subject a\ngood UX in order to keep them hooked and leave them wanting more. All the\nbackground work that goes on while designing a product that is a perfect fit for\nthe customer includes UI UX design.`}</p>\n      <p>{`It’s important to understand that UX and UI do go hand-in-hand; you can’t have\none without the other. However, you don’t need to possess UI design skills to be a\nUX designer, and vice versa.`}</p>\n      <div className={styles[\"img-wrapper\"]}>\n  <img src={image1} className=\"img-fluid\" />\n      </div>\n      <p>{`If you think about a house, it begins with the decision to start builing a place for\nyourself, to live breathe and spend your life in. Similarly, the design of any\nproduct starts with an idea. The idea about what is the product.`}</p>\n      <p>{`Next comes the stage of designing, You spend hours browsing catalogues,\nwebsites, from one architect to another until you find the one designer, who you\ntrust, will solve all your issues and fulfill all your needs.\nIn a kinda similar way, afters hours and hours of sole searching, you arrive at an\nidea that this is the product we’re going to make, it will slve so and so issues and it\nwill be so and so workable.`}</p>\n      <p>{`Just like architects use a blueprint to construct every part of a house, from\nphysical structures to more complex workings drawings like electrical and\nplumbing, UI UX design describes the hierarchy, navigation, features, and\ninteractions of a website or application.`}</p>\n      <p>{`And just as blueprints are the most valuable document for an architect to use in\nthe construction of a building, UI UX design can be the most powerful tool to\nmake an efficient and workable product.`}</p>\n      <p>{`And just as blueprints are the most valuable document for an architect to use in\nthe construction of a building, UI UX design can be the most powerful tool to\nmake an efficient and workable product.`}</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li parentName=\"ul\">{`framework`}</li>\n        <li parentName=\"ul\">{`research`}</li>\n        <li parentName=\"ul\">{`analysis`}</li>\n        <li parentName=\"ul\">{`arrangement`}</li>\n        <li parentName=\"ul\">{`designing`}</li>\n        <li parentName=\"ul\">{`prototyping`}</li>\n        <li parentName=\"ul\">{`development`}</li>\n        <li parentName=\"ul\">{`compiling the data`}</li>\n        <li parentName=\"ul\">{`background research`}</li>\n        <li parentName=\"ul\">{`designing some more`}</li>\n        <li parentName=\"ul\">{`usability testing`}</li>\n        <li parentName=\"ul\">{`designing the product`}</li>\n        <li parentName=\"ul\">{`execution`}</li>\n        <li parentName=\"ul\">{`deployment`}</li>\n        <li parentName=\"ul\">{`and the work goes on`}</li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>{`After all this work, the product that arrives in the digital marketplace is the MVP\ni.e., Minimal Viable Product.`}</p>\n      <p>{`But the work is not finished yet.
