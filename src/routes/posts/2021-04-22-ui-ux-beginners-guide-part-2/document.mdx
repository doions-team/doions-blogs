As product designers, there is always work in progress,in different things being worked
on from different people. When those people leave — whether temporarily or
permanently — that environment, the design system should live on for those that stay
and those who come.

When working on a design system, some principles should be considered to ensure that
this happens smoothly. Great UX means you’re hitting home on features that create
user engagement. So what are these features?

- Short sentences and paragraphs
- Use headings and subheadings
- Use images to illustrate
- Use plenty of white spaces
- Use calls to action but in moderation
- Make content shareable

## Make it easy

Simple design solves problems and achieves a goal as a solution. Design Systems
should be easy to read, understand and be implemented by any designer who needs to
use them.

If someone joins the team, they should be able to use the design system to quickly
understand the bases and the principles used by the company, per example.

## Have documentation

Documentation is more than what teaches us how to use things. It is the source of truth
of what, how and when to use components and modules so that any person can use
them without doubts.

This way, we can build an efficient workflow where people can create without
constraints and others can go on vacation without being worried about what’s left
behind.

## Share the vision

It’s important to collaborate to create great solutions and not create just for the present
but also to share the vision for the future of a specific design component/module.

This way, we can already start thinking of expanding and improving not only on one
thing but also on collaborating it to different aspects, notably if discussed with other
people.

## Good design is long-lasting

Good design practices imply that it outlives the first designers that worked on it and that
others can use that in the long run. And to ensure that this happens, there should be
strong bases, which is well documented and well thought out.

## Collaboration is key

Working with others allows us to make the best decisions and make better decisions
formed with more input and more consideration and points of view.

Solving problems is much easier when done collaboratively — and this means involving
designers, product managers, developers and others.

A lot of people argue what is more important, good UX or good UI, and I always tend to
say — both. If one fails you can’t make an impact on your users. However, oftentimes
users don’t think of what the UX is and value a product based on its looks.

Knowing your content’s edge will help you use screen space more efficiently and
choose the right UI treatment for each piece of the interface. But keep in mind that
edges aren’t only about what you have currently. A good designer should always think
proactively, allowing for the possibility clients may need to scale the UI in the future.

When you’re designing a user interface, don’t forget the main purpose of any user
interface: to provide as smooth as possible an interaction between the user and the
service. Interfaces are no place for doubts, questions without answers, or any kind of
uncertainty.

That’s quite enough for this time, watch this space to know more !
